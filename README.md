### OOCSS and BEM

* `.listing-card` — is the “block” and represents the higher-level component. Stores the structure.
* `.listing-card__title` — is an “element” and represents a descendant of `.listing-card`. Stores the structure.
* `.listing-card_featured` — is a “modifier” and represents a different state or variation on the `.listing-card` block. Stores state, behavior and design.
